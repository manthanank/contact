# Contact Form Project

This is a simple contact form web page created by Manthan Ankolekar using static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project is hosted on GitHub, and you can view it [here](https://manthanank.github.io/contact/).

## Project Overview

The contact form allows users to input their name, email, and a comment, and submit the form. The form is validated using HTML's `required` attribute for essential fields.
